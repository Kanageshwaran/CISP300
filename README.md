Project: Struct-Based Time Conversion Utility

Overview

The Struct-Based Time Conversion Utility is a Python program that demonstrates how structured data can be created, passed to functions, and returned as a single object. The application converts a user-entered number of total days into an organized representation of weeks and remaining days, emphasizing structured programming concepts rather than simple arithmetic.

This project was developed as part of coursework at American River College and focuses on understanding how functions interact with structured data and how data members behave when a structure is returned from a function.

Project Objectives

-Demonstrate how to define a struct-like data structure using a Python class
-Practice returning structured data from functions instead of multiple primitive values
-Understand how data members are copied and preserved when a structure is returned
-Apply modular programming principles to improve clarity and maintainability

Design & Implementation

The program defines a struct-like class that groups related data fields—specifically, the number of calculated weeks and remaining days. A dedicated conversion function accepts the total number of days as input, performs the calculation, and returns an instance of the structured object.

This approach models real-world software design practices where related data is encapsulated and passed between components as a single unit. The project reinforces concepts commonly found in lower-level languages such as C, while leveraging Python’s object abstraction for readability and simplicity.

Key Concepts Demonstrated
-Structured data design using classes
-Function input/output with composite data types
-Data encapsulation and abstraction
-Modular code organization
-Problem decomposition and validation

Technologies Used
-Python
-Structured programming concepts
-Object-oriented fundamentals

Learning Outcomes

This project strengthened foundational skills in structured programming and function design, which are essential for larger applications involving data processing, systems programming, and object-oriented software development.
